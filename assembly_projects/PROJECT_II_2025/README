While converting this program I came across issues such as the program not accepting valid inputs, text not printing correctly, recognising invalid inputs but still using them in the sum, buffer overflow and more.
One slight issue that does not affect the functionality of the program is that a newline has to be entered to proceed to the next input, e.g. enter has to be pressed twice. This is because I added support for newline characters at the end of the 10 byte limit to solve a different issue, and any attempt to fix it has just broken something else.

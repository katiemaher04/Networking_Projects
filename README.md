My networking project using Cisco Packet Tracer
- In this project, I designed a secure prototype network for a simulated retail company with HQ + branch offices.
- I also implemented VLANs, DHCP, static IPv4/IPv6 routing, and wireless access with security measures including port security, DHCP snooping, and ARP inspection.
